# Gitbook Plugin for robots.txt

This plugin will copy a robots.txt found in your root dir into place on the 
hosted GitBook site. To change the path to the file that this plugin will copy,
you may use the `"robots-txt"` plugin config option in your book.json like so:

```json
    "pluginsConfig": {
        "robots-txt": {
            "path": "./path/to/your/robots.txt"
        }
    }
```
